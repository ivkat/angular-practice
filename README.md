These are my practices for the Angular 9 course I'm taking in Udemy
Practices comprehend concepts like:

- Event Listeners
- Pipes
- Angular Components & Databinding
- Directives
- HTTP Requests
- Services & Dependency Injection
- Routing
- Observables
- Angular Forms

#Note
For reasons of size, every section has the "node_modules" folders missing.
If you want to run the solution, It will be necessary to add this folder by running "npm install" from your console.
